help me complete the following tasks

# add `--select` to all subcommands

This option should provide user with ability to query a specific subsets of fields. The documentation is available at https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/get-lists-of-entities/select-fields 

If `--select` is not selected then don't include select in the parameters and it will return the all by default.

Also make sure the table display are aware sometimes so columns can be missing if custom fields are selected
